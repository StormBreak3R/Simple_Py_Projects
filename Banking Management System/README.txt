Hello, 
Its Ahsanul Haque. This is my very first pyhton based project.
i would  like to clear  some points here.

* I have applied the object oriented manner to implement this project,
 i am not good at OOP, still  learning and practicing OOP in python.
* I tried my best to make a effecient Banking management system and tried to implement 
 all possible features.
* Its the implementation of the design document, i tried my best to implement the program as
 described in the design document, still i  might miss  something.
* I will add comment for  every possible line so that anyone can understand the entire senario easily.

* If you have any question or  suggestion feel free to contact me anytime.
